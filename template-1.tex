\section{Overview and Goals}\label{sec:overview}
The GD'25 Creative Topic dataset models events (vertices) from \emph{Dark} with typed edges (causality, time travel, world swaps, quantum entanglement) across three worlds (Jonas, Martha, Origin) \cite{DarkGraphReddit}. The visualization is a static ultra-wide image (12288$\times$1200) designed for a 360$^\circ$ cylindrical display and unwrapped to a 10.24:1 poster.

We answer: (Q1) How do causal loops traverse worlds and epochs? (Q2) Which events/characters bridge worlds or initiate apocalypses? (Q3) What minimal trigger backbone sustains the paradox cycle? The design combines classic storyline aesthetics (e.g., movie narrative charts \cite{XKCDMovieNarrative}) with dynamic storyline layout principles and guidance on vertical encodings \cite{TanahashiMa2012Storyline,Arendt2017YMatters} for readable character/event threads under extreme aspect ratio.

\section{Method and Encodings}\label{sec:method}
Data: we keep all apocalypse/quantum events, deaths, and nodes on causal paths between triggers and apocalypses; optional low-impact events are aggregated into contextual bands to reduce crossings.

Ordering/placement: for each day-world slice we compute a stable order via spectral seriation with local swaps and resolve residual cycles using a feedback-arc heuristic (SVEN-inspired). Vertical positions minimize bends and enforce extra spacing around high-degree trigger/paradox-breaking events; world swaps duplicate character tokens to avoid long diagonals.

Edges and nodes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Nodes: circle (standard), diamond (important trigger), triangle (death); hue encodes world (Jonas=blue, Martha=magenta, Origin=gold); quantum events have a light outline.
  \item Causality edges: semi-transparent, near-monotone curves; time-travel edges: cyan (successful) / amber (failed) with distinct dash/glow; world swaps: slim double-stroke portals annotated with character IDs; entanglement: haloed strokes.
\end{itemize}

360$^\circ$ mapping: global ordinal time maps to angle and unwraps linearly to the x-axis; worlds occupy horizontal macro-bands (top: Jonas, mid: Martha, bottom: Origin) with an \emph{Origin Fold} glyph at the bifurcation. Subtle sinusoidal micro-oscillations on character lines improve trackability and reduce moir√©.

Guiding questions: Q1 loop clusters appear as knot-like motifs where backward time-travel arcs intersect forward chains; entanglement edges mark creation/resolution of paradoxes. Q2 bridge characters manifest as high-betweenness trajectories crossing world bands via swap portals. Q3 a directed-Steiner extraction highlights a sparse, saturated backbone supporting the overall mesh.

Output: the final poster is a single PNG at 12288$\times$1200. A matching legend band is placed at the far left/right margins to leverage peripheral viewing in the arena.

%\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
%In brief: a static yet immersion-aware storyline view that reinterprets time as angle and worlds as strata, emphasizing non-linear causality in \emph{Dark} within the contest constraints.
